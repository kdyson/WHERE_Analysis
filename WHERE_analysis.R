## This file analyzes the analysis-ready data created in the sister file
## WHERE_processing.R. Here we create the percentages and figures needed for
## publication.

## The full workflow for this project is as follows: data collection (Data
## Collection WHERE only Excel) --> compile all journal information and export
## as .csv (Combined Data WHERE.csv) --> process raw data into analysis-ready
## table (WHERE_processing.R) --> analyze data and create figures for publication
